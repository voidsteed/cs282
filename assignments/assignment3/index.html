<h3>Concurrent Ping-Pong Program (Assignment 3)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment, you will implement a program that uses a
pattern-oriented ping-pong framework to spawn threads that correctly
alternate printing "Ping" and "Pong", respectively on either the
command-line display (of the Eclipse IDE) or in an Android TextView
(in either the AVD emulator or on an actual Android device). <A>

<H4>Program Description</H4>

In this directory you'll find Java source code, AndroidManifest.xml,
and associated XML metadata files.  The directory
A3-Android/src/edu/vuum/mocca/ contains the skeleton Java code that
you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments
to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF
THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here" portions!!! <P>

Although there are a lot of files, the actual amount of code you need
to write is relatively localized - the main goal is to understand the
pattern-oriented ping-pong framework and how to apply various Java
synchronization mechanisms.  In particular, you'll need to do the
following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Read and understand the PingPongThreadSema and PingPongThreadCond
  classes, which are covered in the <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfSujb1vBrM&index=21&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Java
  Synchronization and Scheduling Example (Part 1)</A> and <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBj0LJliwPc&index=22&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Java
  Synchronization and Scheduling Example (Part 2)</a> videos. <P>

<LI> To understand these classes you'll also want to understand the Java
  ReentrantLock and ConditionObject, which are covered in the 
  <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDTCuE5W-mA&index=16&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Java
  ReentrantLock</A> and <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8HIjRXZ6Ms&index=19&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Java
  ConditionObject</A> videos. <P>
  
<LI> Finish the implementations of PingPongThreadQueue and PingPongThreadBall, which involves understanding
BlockingQueues as well as implementing the PingPongPaddle class which uses ReentrantLocks and Condition
objects. <P>

<LI> Implement the hook methods in the ConsolePlatformStrategy.java and
  AndroidPlatformStrategy.java classes that use a Java CountDownLatch,  
  which is covered in the <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeBvP_ygiWE&index=20&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Java
  CountDownLatch</A> video. <P>

</ul>

You'll need to build this Android application in the Eclipse ADT
environment.  By default, the output for the correct solution should
look similar to this for Eclipse command-line:

<code><pre>
Ready...Set...Go!
ping(1)
pong(1)
ping(2)
pong(2)
ping(3)
pong(3)
ping(4)
pong(4)
ping(5)
pong(5)
ping(6)
pong(6)
ping(7)
pong(7)
ping(8)
pong(8)
ping(9)
pong(9)
ping(10)
pong(10)
Done!
</code></pre>

BTW, the test assumes that each line of text is formatted: <text
content> + '\n' <P>

To Run the Android Application, right click on the 'A3-Android'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Application] <P>

To Run the Android Unit Test, right click on the 'A3-Android-Test'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Unit Test] <P>

To Run the Java Console application, right click on the 'A3-Android'
project and select [Run As] -> [Java Application] <P>

Note: Some versions of the ADT Plugin may not be able to run on the console by default.
The current workaround is as follows: <P>

1. Right Click on the project -> "Run As" -> "Run Configurations" <BR>
2. Select "Java Application" and then "Main" <BR>
3. Open the tab "Classpath" and remove the "Android Libraries" under "Bootstrap Entities" <BR>
4. Click "Run" and your project should run properly (assuming you've implemented everything correctly).<P>

Finally, while you have implemented different synchronization strategies for the PingPongClass, only one strategy is used in the application at any given time. To use/test different strategies, you must edit Options.java, which contains a member called "mSyncMechanism". Changing this will make the application use different strategies. For example setting it to "QUEUE" will use your BlockingQueue strategy, while setting it to "PADDLE" will use your paddle/ball strategy. <BR>

<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using Eclipse ADT, Java Threads, and
synchronization mechanisms.  It doesn't require detailed knowledge of
Android concurrency frameworks, which we'll cover in upcoming
assignments.
