/**
 * @class SimulationManager
 *
 * @brief This class manages the Palantiri acquisition simulation.
 *        The simulation begins in the start() method, which is called
 *        by the UI Thread and is provided three parameters: (1) the
 *        number of beings to simulate, (2) the number of palantiri to
 *        simulate, and (3) a reference to UIControls, which will be
 *        used to manipulate the UI.
 * 
 *        The simulation should run as follows: the correct number of
 *        palantiri should be instantiated and added to the
 *        PalantirManager.  A Java Thread should be created for each
 *        Being.  Each Thread should attempt to acquire a palantir a
 *        certain number of times (defined as a constant below).  As
 *        this is happening, Threads should call the appropriate
 *        methods in UIControls to demonstrate which palantiri are
 *        being used and which Beings currently own a palantir.
