<h3>Java Threads and Monitor Objects (Assignment 2b)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment, you will reuse the SimpleSemaphore and
SimpleAtomicLong classes implemented in <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a">Assignment
2a</a> to implement an Android application containing a resource
manager that limits the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can
concurrently gaze into a Palantir.  More information on Palantirs is
available <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">here</a> if
you're not yet a fan of Tolkein's Lord of the Ring's. <P>

The Android program's main Activity (provided for you as a skeleton)
will prompt the user to enter the number of Palantiri and Palantir
Beings, where the number of users must be greater than the number of
Palantiri.  A Java Thread will then be started for each Being, which
concurrently attempts to acquire a Palantir and gaze into it for a
certain amount of time.  If the SimpleSemaphore and PalantirManager
are implemented properly the program should succeed without throwing
any exceptions. <P>

<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  However, the only two files you need to modify are
PalantirManager.java in the src/edu/vanderbilt/palantir directory and
the SimulationManager.java in the src/edu/vanderbilt/a2b_android
directory, which contains the skeleton Java code that you'll implement
by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of the PalantirManager. You should use
	your SimpleSemaphore to manage concurrent access to the
	PalantirManager and a HashMap to keep track of which Palantiri
	are currently free and which are being used.

<LI> Instantiate the PalantirManager in the SimulationManager.

<LI> Create a Java Thread for each Being to be simulated and start
	those Threads in the SimulationManager.

<LI> This Android applications uses various features of Java Threads
  and Runnables, which are described <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY5E0o56gaw&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=12">here</a>
  and <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpEeZUjTiS4&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=13">here</a>.
  I recommend you watch these videos and look at the code to ensure
  you understand how to program Java Threads. <P>

</ul>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Eclipse ADT project.
You can run this project by right-clicking the project's name in the
Package Explorer and selecting Run As -> Android Application. Eclipse
ADT should automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming
you have one created. If you do not have one created you can create it
by opening Window -> Android Virtual Device Manager. <P>

The program will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes
a simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Green means gazing, Red means waiting, and Yellow means idle.<P>
<LI> <B>Palantir</B> - Green means not in use, Red means in use.<P>
</UL>

When a Palantir is in use it's colored Red. A "correct" simulation
should restrict the number of gazing Beings to the number of
Palantiri. In other words, if there are four Palantiri in the
simulation, then only four green dots should ever be present on the
screen at a time. <P>

There is a fairness checker built into the UI. It checks to ensure the
Being that has been waiting for a Palantir the longest is the first to
receive a Palantir. However, there's an intentional race condition
inherent in the fairness checker, i.e., two threads may release a
Palantir at almost the same time. The thread that releases the
Palantir first will not necessarily be the first Thread to block on a
call to PalantirManager.acquirePalantir(). If the fairness checker
believes that the PalantirManager is acting unfairly, it will become
yellow to signal a warning that it may not be fair. This is only a
warning because the race condition may create a false negative. <P>

<H4>Additional Work for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must do the following additional work:

<UL>

<LI> In the simulation manager, there are two unimplemented functions:
incrementGazingCountAndCheck() and decrementGazingCount(). You must
implement those functions as defined in the comments to double check
that the PalantirManager is properly limiting the number of threads
that have a Palantir using the SimpleAtomicLong you created in
Assignment2a.
</UL>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment2/A2-Java">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked. <P>

<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using Eclipse ADT, Java Threads, and built-in
monitor objects. It doesn't require any Android concurrency
frameworks, which we'll cover in upcoming assignments.
