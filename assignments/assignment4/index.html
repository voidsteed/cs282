<h3>BouncyBalloons Program (Assignment 4)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment, you will implement parts of an Android program
that allows a user to create balloons that bounce around the screen.
The user will also be able to place barriers on the screen that
restrict the movement of balloons.  Each balloon has a certain number
of times that it can bounce.  Once it bounces the designated number of
time, the balloon "pops" or "explodes", removing the barrier that it
was last in contact with. <P>

You will implement three parts of the assignment: 
<UL>
<LI> A BarrierManager that manages concurrent access to barriers on the screen,

<LI> A subclass of Android AsyncTask that counts how many bounces are
left until all balloons explode, and

<LI> Parts of an Android Activity that uses the Java ExecutorService
to handle moving the balloons around the screen.

</UL>

<H4>Program Description</H4>

In this directory you'll find two projects. One project contains the
Android source code and a majority of the files for the assignment.
The other project contains (1) a driver program that tests how long it
takes for a simulation to run using each of the BarrierManager
implementations and (2) an implementation of BarrierManager that uses
StampedLocks. These projects are separated because StampedLocks are a
part of Java 8, which is not yet supported by Android.  You will
therefore need to install Java 8 if you have not already, as discussed
below. <P>

Implement this assignment by completing the "TODO - You fill in here"
comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL
STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here"
portions!!! <P>

Although there are a lot of files, the actual amount of code you need
to write is relatively localized - the main goal is to understand the
framework and how to apply various Java synchronization mechanisms and
concurrency frameworks. In particular, you'll need to do the
following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Read and understand the Point, BouncyBall, and BouncyBarrier
 classes, which serve as the data model for this assignment.<P>

<LI> Read and understand the BarrierManager and BarrierManagerStrategy
 classes. These classes use the Strategy Pattern to allow the
 application to easily switch between synchronization mechanisms. The
 SynchronizedBarrierManager and CopyOnWriteBarrierManager
 implementations are provided as examples to help guide your
 solutions. <P>
 
<LI> Implement the ReentrantBarrierManager and RWBarrierManager
 classes nested inside BarrierManagerStrategy, which use
 ReentrantLocks and ReentrantReadWriteLocks, respectively, to
 synchronize access to the list of barriers currently being
 managed. Information on these mechanisms can be found in the <A
 HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDTCuE5W-mA&index=16&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Java
 ReentrantLock</A> and <A
 HREF="https://vanderbilt.coursera.org/cs282-001/lecture/281">Java
 ReentrantReadWriteLock</A> videos. <P>
  
<LI> You must also implement the StampedBarrierManager in the Java
 project, which uses StampedLocks and optimistic reading to
 synchronize access to the list of barriers. Information on
 StampedLocks can be found at the end of the <A
 HREF="https://vanderbilt.coursera.org/cs282-001/lecture/281">Java
 StampedLock</A> video. <P>

<LI> Read and understand the BouncyBalloonRunnable class, which
     manages a balloon as it moves around the screen. <P>

<LI> Read and understand the MainActivity class, then fill in the
 parts that use the Java ExecutorService to move the balloons around
 the screen via multiple Threads.  You'll need to instantiate the
 ExecutorService, add BouncyBalloonRunnables to it when appropriate,
 and shut the service down when the application closes or the user
 hits the "Clear" button. These spots are clearly marked with "//
 TODO" comments. More information on the Java Executor framework can
 be found in the <A
 HREF="https://vanderbilt.coursera.org/cs282-001/lecture/297"> Java
 Executor Framework</A> videos. <P>
  
<LI> Implement the BouncesLeftTask, which extends the Android
 AsyncTask and is nested inside MainActivity. This task should
 calculate how many bounces will happen before all balloons explode in
 the background, and then create a toast that displays the
 result. More information on AsyncTasks and Toasts can be found in the
 <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o92SLinqk"> Android
 AsyncTask Framework </A> video and <A
 href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html">
 Toasts </A> documentation.

</ul>

We do not provide any unit tests for this assignment. There is a
TimedTest in the Java project, but this is used mainly to demonstrate
the efficiency differences between the different BarrierManager
implementations. Correct functionality will have to be confirmed
visually using the emulator. <P>

To Run the Android Application, right click on the 'A4-Android'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Application] <P>

To Run the Java Timed Test on the console, right click on the
'A4-Java' project and select [Run As] -> [Java Application] <P>

To get the StampedLock implementation to compile, you will have to
install Java 8 if you have not already and set it as the project's
compiler. At the time of this writing, the steps to install Java 8
with Eclipse are generally as follows: <P>

<UL>

<LI>Download the correct software package for your system from Oracle
at:<br> <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
</a>

<LI>Execute the installer and specify an install directory somewhere on your machine.

<LI>In Eclipse, select [Window] -> [Preferences] -> [Java] -> [Installed JRE's] -> [Add]

<LI>Select [Standard VM] and hit [Next].

<LI>Select [Directory] and find the directory you installed Java 8 to. Then select [Finish].

<LI>Check the box next to the JDK you just installed and hit [Ok].

</UL>

Finally, while you have implemented different synchronization
strategies for the BarrierManagerStrategy, only one strategy is used
in the Android application at any given time. To use/test different
strategies, you must edit Options.java, which contains a member called
"MANAGER_STRATEGY". Changing this will make the application use
different strategies. For example, setting it to
"Strategy.Synchronized" will force it to use the synchronized keyword
strategy. <BR>

<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to demonstrate the performance difference
between different types of locking mechanisms and to get you familiar
with using the Java Executor framework and the Android AsyncTask
concurrency framework.
